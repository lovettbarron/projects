Pedel Pedel Club wasa side project developed in 2016 while waiting for my security clearance to go through for the US Department of Defense. It is a cycling app that provides an easy reward and budgetting structure on putting in the miles that leverages two behavioural insights tied to new cyclists:

1. New cyclists buy way more gear than they need at too much expense or;
2. New cyclists don't buy enough of the right gear, creating a bloackage for themselves.

PPC was focused as a desktop app since my goal with it was to explore nice desktop interactions. This ended up being a big mistake, since an overwhelming number of my users were on mobile.

PPC was featured as a top Strava app in Bicycling magazine, and was selected as one of the top 25 Strava API apps by Strava.
