Knowsi is a Consent Management pleatform built on NextJS and Apollo. Originally developed as a side project in 2019, Knowsi was awarded the 2020 Sage Concept grant by Sage Publishing and went through a few rounds of iteration in an attempt to find a good market fit as a "one man band" indie startup.

Knowsi was put on hold at the end of 2022 when I shut down my US business (since it was only running Knowsi at that point at a loss), and will restart with a refactor sometime in the future with a refactor and rewrite of the backend.
